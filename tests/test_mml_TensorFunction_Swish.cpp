/**
 * @file test_mml_TensorFunction_Swish.cpp
 * @brief Unit tests for the SwishFunction class.
 *
 * This file contains test cases that validate the correctness of the
 * SwishFunction class by checking its `func`, `derivative`, and `primitive`
 * methods using predefined tensors. Unlike some of the other tests for
 * activation function this test simply makes sure that the return from the
 * functions are within an expected range of the correct value.
 *
 * The tests verify that:
 * - `func()` correctly applies Swish to each tensor element.
 * - `derivative()` correctly computes and applies the derivative of Swish.
 *
 * - `primitive()` correctly computes and applies the approximation primitive of Swish.
 *
 * Each test outputs a success/failure message using `assert_msg` and ensures
 * correct behavior of the ReLUFunction implementation.
